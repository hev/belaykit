Make % of context more front and center and showcase in a thermobar (this is most of what I care about when monitoring runs).\n3. Indent tool use under assistant completion calls to show hiearchy of tool use.\n4. When an assistant session starts draw the [assitant] part before the call so we now it's waiting on a LLM call if it's paused.\n5. Move the model and agent name into the [assistant/tool] part and make the meta data part purely metrics. ",
